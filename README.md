# BEdita App

This is the BEdita frontend base app.

## Configuration

Read and edit the environment specific `config/app_local.php` and setup the
`'Datasources'` and any other configuration relevant for your application.
Other environment agnostic settings can be changed in `config/app.php`.

## Layout

The app skeleton uses [Milligram](https://milligram.io/) (v1.3) minimalist CSS
framework by default. You can, however, replace it with any other library or
custom styles.
